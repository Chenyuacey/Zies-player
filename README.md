# Zies-player

Before running, you must change the path in code or move the pictures from PIC/* to the directory which the code file exist in, and you also  can change the style of the player by using your own pictures.

As for the songs, the file suffix must be ".wav", because this player can only play the file of this format.The song file must be named as Artist_name-Song_name,such as "林俊杰-醉赤壁", you can NOT leave any SPACE in the file name.By the way,the lirics file is imported from the "*.lrc", and its' suffix must ve ".txt", the rule of naming is the same as the song fime.
